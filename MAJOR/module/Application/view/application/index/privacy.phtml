We are committed to excellence in customer service, and your privacy is important to us. This is the Privacy Policy for all UCEazy websites, including the website currently located at www.UCEazy.com (collectively "Site" or "Sites"). We have prepared this Privacy Policy to explain how we collect, use, and protect Personal Information (defined below) and Non-Personal Information (defined below) when you use the Site and your choices for managing your information preferences.

                  <p><strong>Personal Information</strong></p>
                  <p>UCEazy does not collect information that personally identifies you, such as your name, address, email address, social security number and similar identifying information ("Personal Information"), unless you expressly provide it to us through one of our online services. If you choose to register on a Site in order to utilize an online service that requires you to log in, UCEazy may collect basic Personal Information. You may verify, correct, update, or change your registration information at any time by e-mailing us at privacy@UCEazy.com or click here to log in to your account. The Site enables you to voluntarily provide Personal Information to third parties such as college or university admissions departments. </p>

                  <p><strong>Non-Personal Information</strong></p>
                  <p>We automatically collect information that does not reflect or reference an individually identifiable user to help us understand how our users use the Site. Like most websites, we automatically collect and use the data contained in log files. The information in the log files may include your IP (internet protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider), the Web browser you used to visit the Site, the time you visited the Site, which Web pages you visited on the Site, and other anonymous Site usage data. We call this type of information "Non-Personal Information."</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Cookies and Web Beacons</strong></p>
                  <p>We use cookies (a small file containing a string of characters that uniquely identifies your Web browser) and Web beacons (an electronic file placed within a Web site that monitors usage). We use cookies and Web beacons to improve the quality of the Site. Most Web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your Web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, certain features of the Site may not work if you delete or disable cookies. Certain of our Service Providers (defined below) may use cookies and Web beacons in connection with the services they perform on our behalf, including, without limitation, marketing and advertising campaigns.</p>

                  <p><strong>How we use Personal Information and Non-Personal Information</strong></p>
                  <p>We use Personal Information and Non-Personal Information for internal purposes, such as to notify you of new or relevant products or services, to send service notifications, to customize the advertising and content you see, to fulfill your requests for products and services, to improve the Site, to conduct research, to solicit your feedback and input about the Site, and to provide more relevant products, services, and advertisements on or through the Site. Personal Information and Non-Personal Information may be combined with data collected from other sources so that we may further improve the relevance of products, services, and advertisements offered to you or on or through the Site.</p>
                  <p>From time to time, we might establish a business relationship with other persons or entities whom we believe trustworthy and whom we have asked to confirm that their privacy practices are consistent with ours ("Service Providers"). For example, we may contract with Service Providers to provide certain services, such as credit card processing, advertising, analytics tools, widget providers, data management services, Web hosting, and Web development. We provide our Service Providers with the information reasonably necessary for them to perform these services. Each Service Provider must agree to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information involved in order to protect your information from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure.</p>
                  <p>We may use, and disclose to third parties, certain Non-Personal Information regarding the Site (e.g., number of visits, page views, number of registered members who reside in a particular geographic location, etc.). However, such information does not identify you individually.</p>
                  <p>We may work with third-party marketing and advertising companies including Yahoo! Inc. and Google Inc. which may use information about your visit to the Site in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you on the Site and on third-party websites. From the Site, these companies may place or recognize a unique cookie on your computer or use other technologies such as Web beacons or pixel tags. We may use Google Analytics and the Doubleclick cookie to serve ads based on a user's prior visit to the Site. Users may opt out of the Doubleclick cookie by visiting <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/" title="How Google uses cookies in advertising" target="_blank">this page</a>. Users may opt out of Google Analytics by visiting this page. Our Privacy Policy does not cover any use of information that a third-party advertisement serving company may collect from you.

                  <p>In certain instances we may disclose Personal Information and Non-Personal Information when we believe it is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against persons or entities in order to protect UCEazy or our users or when we believe that the law or legal process requires such disclosure.</p>
