                  <p><strong>Limitation of Liability</strong></p>
                  <p>YOU UNDERSTAND THAT TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL UCEAZY OR ITS OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, DIRECTORS, SHAREHOLDERS, PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, AGENTS, OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE) FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF REVENUES, PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES (EVEN IF SUCH PARTIES WERE ADVISED OF, KNEW OF, OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES), RESULTING FROM YOUR (OR ANYONE USING YOUR ACCOUNT'S) USE OF THE SITE.</p>

                  <p><strong>Exclusions and Limitations</strong></p>
                  <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages. Accordingly, some of the above limitations and disclaimers may not apply to you. To the extent UCEazy may not, as a matter of applicable law, disclaim any implied warranty or limit its liabilities, the scope and duration of such warranty and the extent of UCEazy' liability shall be the minimum permitted under such applicable law.</p>

                  <p><strong>Indemnity</strong></p>
                  <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless UCEazy, its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, employees, consultants, and agents from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, expenses, fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs) that such parties may incur as a result of or arising from
                  <ol type="a">
                    <li>any information or content you (or anyone using your account) submit, post, or transmit on or through the Site;</li>
                    <li>your (or anyone using your account's) use of the Site;</li>
                    <li>your (or anyone using your account's) violation of these Terms of Use; or</li>
                    <li>your (or anyone using your account's) violation of any rights of any other person or entity, including, without limitation, any copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret, other intellectual property, or proprietary rights of any person or entity. UCEazy reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will cooperate with UCEazy in asserting any available defenses.</li>
                  </ol>
                  </p>

                  <p><strong>Force Majeure</strong></p>
                  <p>Without limiting the foregoing, under no circumstances will UCEazy be held liable for any delay or failure in performance due in whole in or in part to any acts of nature, forces, or causes beyond its reasonable control, including, without limitation, Internet failures, computer equipment failures, software bugs, telecommunication equipment failures, other equipment failures, electrical power failures, strikes, labor disputes, riots, insurrections, civil disturbances, shortages of labor or materials, fires, floods, earthquakes, storms, explosions, acts of God, war, governmental actions, orders of domestic or foreign courts or tribunals, non-performance of third parties, or loss of or fluctuations in heat, light, or air conditioning.</p>


                  <p><strong>Termination</strong></p>
                  <p>If you violate any of these Terms of Use, your permission to use the Site and the Content automatically terminates.</p>

                  <p><strong>Modifications to the Site</strong></p>
                  <p>UCEazy reserves the right to modify or discontinue the Site with or without notice to you. UCEazy shall not be liable to you or any third party should UCEazy exercise its right to modify or discontinue the Site.</p>

                  <p><strong>Other Provisions</strong></p>
                  <p>These Terms of Use shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to any conflict of laws rules or provisions. If any provision of these Terms of Use shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. The failure of UCEazy to enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision. These Terms of Use, together with UCEazy' Privacy Policy and any other rules or guidelines posted in connection with the Site, are the entire and exclusive agreement between UCEazy and you regarding the Site, and these Terms of Use supersede and replace any prior agreements between UCEazy and you regarding the Site.</p>

                  <p><strong>Arbitration Agreement</strong></p>

                  <p>You and UCEazy agree that we will resolve any disputes between us through binding and final arbitration instead of through court proceedings. All controversies, claims, counterclaims, or other disputes arising between you and UCEazy relating to the Site or these Terms of Use (each a "Claim") shall be submitted for binding arbitration in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA Rules"). The arbitration will be heard and determined by a single arbitrator. The arbitrator's decision in any such arbitration will be final and binding upon the parties and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties agree that the arbitration will be kept confidential and that the existence of the proceeding and any element of it (including, without limitation, any pleadings, briefs, documents, or other evidence submitted or exchanged and any testimony or other oral submissions and awards) will not be disclosed beyond the arbitration proceedings, except as may lawfully be required in judicial proceedings relating to the arbitration or by applicable disclosure rules and regulations of securities regulatory authorities or other governmental agencies.</p>
                  <p>If you demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, UCEazy will pay as much of the administrative costs and arbitrator's fees required for the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the cost of the arbitration from being prohibitive. In the final award, the arbitrator may apportion the costs of arbitration and the compensation of the arbitrator among the parties in such amounts as the arbitrator deems appropriate.</p>
                  <p>This arbitration agreement does not preclude you from seeking action by federal, state, or local government agencies. You and UCEazy also have the right to bring qualifying claims in small claims court. In addition, you and UCEazy retain the right to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for provisional relief, including pre-arbitral attachments or preliminary injunctions, and any such request shall not be deemed incompatible with these Terms of Use, nor a waiver of the right to have disputes submitted to arbitration as provided herein.</p>
                  <p>Neither you nor UCEazy may act as a class representative or private attorney general, nor participate as a member of a class of claimants, with respect to any Claim. Claims may not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis. The arbitrator can decide only your and/or UCEazy' individual Claims. The arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated. This Section 15 will survive the termination of your relationship with UCEazy.</p>
                  <p>THIS SECTION LIMITS CERTAIN RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO MAINTAIN A COURT ACTION, THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY FORM OF CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIM, THE RIGHT TO ENGAGE IN DISCOVERY EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN AAA RULES, AND THE RIGHT TO CERTAIN REMEDIES AND FORMS OF RELIEF. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU OR UCEAZY WOULD HAVE IN COURT ALSO MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION.</p>

                  <p><strong>Terms of Use Changes</strong></p>
                  <p>UCEazy may, in its sole and absolute discretion, change these Terms of Use from time to time. UCEazy will post a copy of the Terms of Use as changed on the Site. Your continued use of the Site constitutes your agreement to abide by the Terms of Use as changed. If you object to any such changes, your sole recourse shall be to cease using the Site.</p>
